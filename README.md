# Smash-Discord-Bot-Leaderboard
Discord bot that updates your scoreboard on OBS via linking files to your OBS. 
This bot currently operates on your own computer and using your own bot, you will have to create a discord bot with basic adminstrative permissions. 
Things currently missing will be the token needed to have the bot online, and you will have to connect each file to OBS wherever you want the names to be on screen 
Once you do that you can run the file and the bot will run with its basic commands.
